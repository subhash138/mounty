        <h4>Run</h4>
        <p>Mothers are the universal symbol of unconditional love and one of the things that this ensures is that it spurs numerous thriller premises or 
		character sketches. The mother that would kill to protect her offspring has been depicted multiple times on television shows and movies. Moreover,
		this leads to another representation- that of the mother with a sinister secret. The fact that mothers are seen as pure beings fuels this idea, 
		making it more impactful. For instance, the television series, ‘The Act’ was an example of this trope. The upcoming thriller, ‘Run’ by Aneesh Chaganty
		employs a similar premise. </p>
